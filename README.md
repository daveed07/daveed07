**`Web Developer and Designer`**

I'm a seasoned web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and SQL. Over the years, I've deployed numerous projects on Heroku and Netlify, gaining valuable experience in these platforms. My most notable project is Nappshop, an e-commerce store that I've poured countless hours into.

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge base by studying cybersecurity, with a particular interest in networks and artificial intelligence. My ultimate professional goal is to make a significant impact in the tech industry by contributing to innovative and exciting projects.

When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me immersed in a good book or training at the gym. I believe in a balanced life where personal growth and health are just as important as professional development.
